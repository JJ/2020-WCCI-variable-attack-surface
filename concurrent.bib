abstract="To solve optimization problems, in the field of engineering optimization, an optimal value of a specific function must be found, in a limited time, within a constrained or unconstrained domain. Metaheuristic methods are useful for a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, which accelerate being able to achieve optimal or near-optimal solutions. The metaheuristic method called Jaya has generated growing interest because of its simplicity and efficiency. We present Jaya-based parallel algorithms to efficiently exploit cluster computing platforms (heterogeneous memory platforms). We propose a multi-level parallel algorithm, in which, to exploit distributed-memory architectures (or multiprocessors), the outermost layer of the Jaya algorithm is parallelized. Moreover, in internal layers, we exploit shared-memory architectures (or multicores) by adding two more levels of parallelization. This two-level internal parallel algorithm is based on both a multipopulation structure and an improved heuristic search path relative to the search path of the sequential algorithm. The multi-level parallel algorithm obtains average efficiency values of 84{\%} using up to 120 and 135 processes, and slightly accelerates the convergence with respect to the sequential Jaya algorithm.",

abstract="Most of the complex research problems can be formulated as optimization problems. Emergence of big data technologies have also commenced the generation of complex optimization problems with large size. The high computational cost of these problems has rendered the development of optimization algorithms with parallelization. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is one of the most popular swarm intelligence-based algorithm, which is enriched with robustness, simplicity and global search capabilities. However, one of the major hindrance with PSO is its susceptibility of getting entrapped in local optima and; alike other evolutionary algorithms the performance of PSO gets deteriorated as soon as the dimension of the problem increases. Hence, several efforts are made to enhance its performance that includes the parallelization of PSO. The basic architecture of PSO inherits a natural parallelism, and receptiveness of fast processing machines has made this task pretty convenient. Therefore, parallelized PSO (PPSO) has emerged as a well-accepted algorithm by the research community. Several studies have been performed on parallelizing PSO algorithm so far. Proposed work presents a comprehensive and systematic survey of the studies on PPSO algorithms and variants along with their parallelization strategies and applications.",

abstract = "Difficult search and optimization problems, usually solved by metaheuristics, are very often implemented in concurrent and parallel environment, as many metaheuristics (e.g. population- or agent-based) are inherently easy to parallelize. Therefore search for easy-to-use, robust and efficient frameworks dedicated for such computing methods, especially in the era of ubiquitous many and multi-core systems, is very desirable. Indeed, the development of multi-core architectures is incredibly fast and multicore CPUs can be found nowadays not only in supercomputers, but also in ordinary laptops or even phones. Efficient use of multicore architectures requires applying suitable languages and technologies, like Erlang. Its concurrency model, based on lightweight processes and asynchronous message-passing, seems very well suited for running massively concurrent code on many cores. Most of existing Erlang industrial applications are deployed on computers with up to 24 CPU cores, and there are hardly any reports on using Erlang on architectures exceeding 32 physical cores. In this paper we present our experiences with developing a concurrent Erlang-based computing platform, scaling computationally-intensive and memory-intensive applications up to 64 cores, using as examples global optimization and urban traffic planning problems."

abstract = {Summary This paper introduces a new formal description of the execution model for agent-based computing systems in the form of an adaptive dataflow decoupled from the domain-specific semantics of the computation. We show that the execution models studied in previous work can be unified in this common model. The parameters of the model such as queuing policies and granularity of the data in the flow are analyzed. Several queueing alternatives are benchmarked to demonstrate how they affect the efficiency of the computation. Using the example of a multi-agent evolutionary optimisation problem solver, the new approach is shown to outperform the classic one. This proposed model is well suited to functional languages and can be easily mapped onto different classes of hardware – from simple single-core computers to distributed environments.},

abstract="Evolutionary multi-agent systems (EMAS) play a critical role in many artificial intelligence applications that are in use today. In this paper, we present a new generic skeleton in Erlang for parallel EMAS computations. The skeleton enables us to capture a wide variety of concrete evolutionary computations that can exploit the same underlying parallel implementation. We demonstrate the use of our skeleton on two different evolutionary computing applications: (1) computing the minimum of the Rastrigin function; and (2) solving an urban traffic optimisation problem. We show that we can obtain very good speedups (up to 142.44                                                                          {\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}                                                            {\texttimes}                                                       the sequential performance) on a variety of different parallel hardware, while requiring very little parallelisation effort.",

Exploiting parallelisation in the cloud might be an affordable approach to getting time efficient solutions that benefit of the appealing features of scalability, resource discovery, reliability, fault-tolerance and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, parallel computation is very prone to cause considerable overhead for communication. Also, making Genetic Algorithms distributed in an on-demand fashion is not trivial. Aiming at keeping under control the communication cost and, at the same time, supporting developers in the construction and deployment of parallel Genetic Algorithms, we designed and implemented a novel approach to distribute Genetic Algorithms in the form of a cloud-based application. It is based on the master/slave model, exploiting software containers, their cloud orchestration and message queues. We also devised a conceptual workflow covering each cloud Genetic Algorithms distribution phase, from resources allocation to actual deployment and execution, in an engineered fashion. Then, the application performance has been evaluated using a benchmark problem. According to the performance and setup times results, it emerged that the cloud can be considered a compelling way of scaling Genetic Algorithms and an excellent alternative to other technologies strictly related to the physically owned hardware."

Many optimum designs of tribological components are highly time-constrained before final productions. It is well-known that the process of a complex simulated design can be considerably accelerated by using some form of parallel computing. Also, for many tribological models additional assumptions can be relaxed with stricter design constrains, if the execution can be speeded up. In this study, the concurrent computing for tribological design is proposed, which is to perform parallel computing using the multitasking capability of today's operating system. In the concurrent computing a master program, which manages the process of the optimization, is used to launch a number of standalone slave programs (air bearing models) in a quick succession. And the operating system (MS-Windows) of the computer manages the parallel execution of the slave programs. Other than the standard programming language (Fortran 95) this approach uses none of the general parallel programming paradigms or directives, such as message passing interface, OpenMP, or coding using graphics processing units. In this study, the algorithm for the multiobjective optimization is group inching fortification method and the concurrent computing is executed in the algorithm-level. High parallel computing speedups are obtained in the simulated bearing designs. The approach can also be applied in using commercial general-purpose packages for modelling and self-coded methods for optimum design of tribological components or systems."

This study is motivated by the success obtained by these models when applied to other meta-heuristics (such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing or VNS) and by the use of a compact representation of the population that make EDAs through probability distributions. This fact can be exploited during information interchange among islands. In this work we experiment with two types of island-based EDAs: (1) migration of individuals, and (2) migration of probability models. Also, two alternatives are studied for the phase of model combinations: assigning constant weights to inner and incoming models or assigning adaptive weights based-on their fitness. The proposed algorithms are tested over a suite of four combinatorial optimization problems.",
