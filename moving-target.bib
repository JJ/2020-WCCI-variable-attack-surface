abstract = "Moving Target Defense (MTD) consists of applying system reconfiguration (e.g., VM migration, IP shuffling) to dynamically change the available attack surface. MTD makes use of reconfiguration to confuse attackers and nullify their knowledge about the system state. It also can be used as an attack reaction (e.g., using Virtual Machine (VM) migration to move VMs away from a compromised host). Thus, MTD seems to be a promising technique to tackle some of the cloud computing security challenges. In this systematic mapping study, we aim to investigate the current research state of Moving Target Defense in the cloud computing context, and to identify potential research gaps in the literature. Considering five major scientific databases in the computer science domain, we collected 224 papers related to the area. After disambiguation and filtering, we selected 95 papers for analysis. The outcome of such analysis offers a comprehensive overview of the current research. We can highlight some relevant research opportunities. First, only a few works present advances in the theoretical field of Moving Target Defense in cloud computing. Second, the proposal and evaluation of multi-layer Moving Target Defense mechanisms is still an open problem. Thirdly, there is a need for frameworks to support MTD evaluation, which may include a benchmark for comparing alternative MTD strategies. Finally, the study of potential impacts of Moving Target Defense in context-oriented clouds is a barely explored topic."

abstract = "With the increasingly connected nature of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), new attack vectors are emerging that were previously not considered in the design process. Specifically, autonomous vehicles are one of the most at risk CPS applications, including challenges such as a large amount of legacy software, non-trusted third party applications, and remote communication interfaces. With zero day vulnerabilities constantly being discovered, an attacker can exploit such vulnerabilities to inject malicious code or even leverage existing legitimate code to take over the cyber part of a CPS. Due to the tightly coupled nature of CPS, this can lead to altering physical behavior in an undesirable or devastating manner. Therefore, it is no longer effective to reactively harden systems, but a more proactive approach must be taken. Moving target defense (MTD) techniques such as instruction set randomization (ISR), and address space randomization (ASR) have been shown to be effective against code injection and code reuse attacks. However, these MTD techniques can result in control system crashing which is unacceptable in CPS applications since such crashing may cause catastrophic consequences. Therefore, it is crucial for MTD techniques to be complemented by control reconfiguration to maintain system availability in the event of a cyber-attack. This paper addresses the problem of maintaining system and security properties of a CPS under attack by integrating moving target defense techniques, as well as detection, and recovery mechanisms to ensure safe, reliable, and predictable system operation. Specifically, we consider the problem of detecting code injection as well as code reuse attacks, and reconfiguring fast enough to ensure the safety and stability of autonomous vehicle controllers are maintained. By using MTD such as ISR, and ASR, our approach provides the advantage of preventing attackers from obtaining the reconnaissance knowledge necessary to perform code injection and code reuse attacks, making sure attackers can’t find vulnerabilities in the first place. Our system implementation includes a combination of runtime MTD utilizing AES 256 ISR and fine grained ASR, as well as control management that utilizes attack detection, and reconfiguration capabilities. We evaluate the developed security architecture in an autonomous vehicle case study, utilizing a custom developed hardware-in-the-loop testbed."

abstract="Moving target defense (MTD) has emerged as one of the game-changing themes to alter the asymmetric situation between attacks and defenses in cyber-security. Numerous related works involving several facets of MTD have been published. However, comprehensive analyses and research on MTD are still absent. In this paper, we present a survey on MTD technologies to scientifically and systematically introduce, categorize, and summarize the existing research works in this field. First, a new security model is introduced to describe the changes in the traditional defense paradigm and security model caused by the introduction of MTD. A function-and-movement model is provided to give a panoramic overview on different perspectives for understanding the existing MTD research works. Then a systematic interpretation of published literature is presented to describe the state of the art of the three main areas in the MTD field, namely, MTD theory, MTD strategy, and MTD evaluation. Specifically, in the area of MTD strategy, the common characteristics shared by the MTD strategies to improve system security and effectiveness are identified and extrapolated. Thereafter, the methods to implement these characteristics are concluded. Moreover, the MTD strategies are classified into three types according to their specific goals, and the necessary and sufficient conditions of each type to create effective MTD strategies are then summarized, which are typically one or more of the aforementioned characteristics. Finally, we provide a number of observations for the future direction in this field, which can be helpful for subsequent researchers.",

Here we want to provide an overview of the research progress in applying CI methods to the problem of intrusion detection. The scope of this review will encompass core methods of CI, including artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, artificial immune systems, swarm intelligence, and soft computing. The research contributions in each field are systematically summarized and compared, allowing us to clearly define existing research challenges, and to highlight promising new research directions. The findings of this review should provide useful insights into the current IDS literature and be a good source for anyone who is interested in the application of CI approaches to IDSs or related fields."

    abstract = {Protection against many cyber security threats can be implemented by existing software on the system, with no need for security software. Some operating systems or program parameters can increase the security level and close any vulnerabilities if they are set properly. This project shows a way to prevent potential attacks with relatively low cost, but this method needs immediate attention. Reconfiguring a machine regularly is a moving target defense which is done by modifying the configuration regularly in the hopes of spoiling an attacker's reconnaissance efforts, the configurations are changed until they reach the fittest solution, so if the configurations are modified after a potential attacker's reconnaissance, then the gathered information is no longer effective. Improving security and utilizing the moving target defense can be implemented through the use of a genetic algorithm. Vulnerabilities can be caused by human misconfiguration or by having the improper chain of parameters, which are impossible to find manually due to the large number of configurations to search through. The genetic algorithm is therefore used to fix this problem by finding the right configuration and the proper chain of parameters until it reaches the fittest configuration possible, which is the main objective of this project. The {GA} has been applied successfully and it has shown flexibility in tightening the security solution by evolving the fitness of the configuration through the generations and by maintaining diversity within the generations. This resulted in high quality configurations which are important within the moving target defense strategy. Investigating the security impact on the Quality of Service ({QoS}) was an objective of this project.

    abstract = {The Software Defined Networking paradigm has enabled dynamic configuration and control of large networks. Although the division of the control and data planes on networks has lead to dynamic reconfigurability of large networks, finding the minimal and optimal set of controllers that can adapt to the changes in the network has proven to be a challenging problem. Recent research tends to favor small solution sets with a focus on either propagation latency or controller load distribution, and struggles to find large balanced solution sets. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm based approach to the controller placement problem that minimizes inter-controller latency, load distribution and the number of controllers with fitness sharing. We demonstrate that the proposed approach provides diverse and adaptive solutions to real network architectures such as the United States backbone and Japanese backbone networks. We further discuss the relevance and application of a diversity focused genetic algorithm for a moving target defense security model.},

    title = {Improving the Diversity Defense of Genetic Algorithm-Based Moving Target Approaches},
    abstract = {One approach for providing a Moving Target ({MT}) defense is to intermediately change a system’s configuration (operating systems and/or applications). For example, Genetic Algorithms ({GAs}) have been successfully used to find alternative configurations that can discount the attacker’s knowledge about the system. Central to the {GA} approach is the chromosome pool, which consists of the best alternative configurations discovered thus far. Unfortunately the pool can possibly “stagnate” if these configurations do not change after a period of time. Although the configurations are secure, this situation limits the diversity the approach can achieve. This paper describes how chromosome pool management can improve the diversity of {GA}-based {MT} environments. The proposed approach “ages” configurations, reducing the fitness (security) of a configuration based on the period of time since it was last active (used as the configuration for the system). As a result, configurations that not been active for a long period of time are considered less secure which can make space in the pool for new alternatives. Simulations results will demonstrate proper pool management can provide a functional, secure, and more diverse {MT} environment.},

    abstract = {Attacks often succeed by abusing the gap between program and machine-level semantics-- for example, by locating a sensitive pointer, exploiting a bug to overwrite this sensitive data, and hijacking the victim program's execution. In this work, we take secure system design on the offensive by continuously obfuscating information that attackers need but normal programs do not use, such as representation of code and pointers or the exact location of code and data. Our secure hardware architecture, Morpheus, combines two powerful protections: ensembles of moving target defenses and churn. Ensembles of moving target defenses randomize key program values (e.g., relocating pointers and encrypting code and pointers) which forces attackers to extensively probe the system prior to an attack. To ensure attack probes fail, the architecture incorporates churn to transparently re-randomize program values underneath the running system. With frequent churn, systems quickly become impractically difficult to penetrate. We demonstrate Morpheus through a {RISC}-V-based prototype designed to stop control-flow attacks. Each moving target defense in Morpheus uses hardware support to individually offer more randomness at a lower cost than previous techniques. When ensembled with churn, Morpheus defenses offer strong protection against control-flow attacks, with our security testing and performance studies revealing: i) high-coverage protection for a broad array of control-flow attacks, including protections for advanced attacks and an attack disclosed after the design of Morpheus, and ii) negligible performance impacts (1\%) with churn periods up to 50 ms, which our study estimates to be at least 5000x faster than the time necessary to possibly penetrate Morpheus.},

    abstract = {Attackers of computer systems must preform reconnaissance on the system prior to attacking it. Knowledge gained through reconnaissance often allows them to ﬁnd ways in which to exploit the system. Moving target defense ({MTD}) is a security strategy that inhibits the reconnaissance phase of an attack by making the system change the way it is conﬁgured, while it is running, at random intervals. The changes a moving target defense implements should maintain system functionality as well as security. Depending on the system being protected the possible number of parameters that can change can be very large. Finding ways to change the parameters that ensure system security is challenging, but with the help of genetic algorithms it can be done eﬀectively. This paper describes the basics of moving target defense, highlights three speciﬁc challenges that go in to the making of an {MTD}, and explains how genetic algorithms can be leveraged to address those challenges.},

    abstract = {A Moving Target ({MT}) defense constantly changes a system's attack surface, in an attempt to limit the usefulness of the reconnaissance the attacker has collected. One approach to this defense strategy is to intermittently change a system's configuration. These changes must maintain functionality and security, while also being diverse. Finding suitable configuration changes that form a {MT} defense is challenging. There are potentially a large number of individual configurations' settings to consider, without a full understanding of the settings' interdependencies. Evolution-based algorithms, which formulate better solutions from good solutions, can be used to create a {MT} defense. New configurations are created based on the security of previous configurations and can be periodically implemented to change the system's attack surface. This approach not only has the ability to discover new, more secure configurations, but is also proactive and resilient since it can continually adapt to the current environment in a fashion similar to systems found in nature. This article presents and compares two genetic algorithms to create a {MT} defense. The primary difference between the two is based on their approaches to mutation. One mutates values, and the other modifies the domains from which values are chosen.},

Yet others believe that the principles of transparency and community involvement actually contribute to higher levels of software quality, including security, than can be achieved in the closed world of proprietary software. It's an important issue as open source projects continue their inroads into mainstream, enterprise solutions. Steve Mansfield-Devine examines the arguments and touches on the efforts being made to develop best practices, methodologies and tools to ensure security in open source software. Debates about open source software quickly develop a religious dimension. And nothing is more likely to set off an argument of inquisitional proportions than accusations of shortcomings in an area as important as security. Two recent events highlighted the issue of the security of open source software ({OSS}): one was a report claiming that open source developers are failing to achieve the necessary standards. The other was a suggestion that Linux kernel developers may have tried to cover up security vulnerabilities. However, when it comes to ensuring the quality of software from a security standpoint, is there really any difference between open source and closed source?},

To increase uncertainty of adversarial reconnaissance, the network administrator (henceforth, defender) can introduce deception into responses to network scans, such as obscuring certain system characteristics. We introduce a novel game theoretic model of deceptive interactions of this kind between a defender and a cyber attacker, which we call the Cyber Deception Game. We consider both a powerful (rational) attacker, who is aware of the defender's exact deception strategy, and a naive attacker who is not. We show that computing the optimal deception strategy is {NP}-hard for both types of attackers. For the case with a powerful attacker, we provide a mixed-integer linear program solution as well as a fast and effective greedy algorithm. Similarly, we provide complexity results and propose exact and heuristic approaches when the attacker is naive. Our extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our approaches.},

    abstract = {The success of products like Apache and Linux has propelled increased awareness and adoption of open source software ({OSS}). Despite increased adoption of {OSS} products, questions about their security and reliability remain. Using four popular {OSS} and proprietary products as an initial sample, we examine the vulnerability patterns in {OSS} and proprietary products. Our analysis suggests that for both proprietary and open source products, in general, severe vulnerabilities are identified relatively late in the product’ s life and continue to emerge months after the software release. In particular, contrary to expectations, detection of vulnerabilities is no faster in open source ({OS}) than proprietary products. However, open source products had lower count of vulnerabiliti es at all levels of severity compared to proprietary products. We propose a conceptual framework to explain the variations in vulnerabilities between the {OS} and proprietary products. Our insights from the study have implications for research and practice.},

    abstract = {With increasingly complex and heterogeneous systems in pervasive service computing, it becomes more and more important to provide self-protected services to end users. In order to achieve self-protection, the corresponding security should be provided in an optimized manner considering the constraints of heterogeneous devices and networks. In this paper, we present a Genetic Algorithms-based approach for obtaining optimized security configurations at run time, supported by a set of security {OWL} ontologies and an event-driven framework. This approach has been realized as a prototype for self-protection in the Hydra middleware, and is integrated with a framework for enforcing the computed solution at run time using security obligations. The experiments with the prototype on configuring security strategies for a pervasive service middleware show that this approach has acceptable performance, and could be used to automatically adapt security strategies in the middleware.},
